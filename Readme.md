# "Top News Channel" - An Automated News Playout System (sourced by i-CABLE News)

A sophisticated automated news playout system that automatically collects news video streams from the Cable News website (https://www.i-cable.com/category/%E6%96%B0%E8%81%9E%E8%B3%87%E8%A8%8A/), concatenantes them, and play it out through Open Broadcasting Software (OBS). The system can be run 24/7. Each news segment is 20 minutes long, with 4 four segments. The news streams are updated at every :20/:40/:60 of the hour. 

The backend of the system is implemented with Python. The automation is implemented with Jenkins and some shell scripting. Some various parts of on-air elements are implemented with simple HTML5/CSS3 scripting as browser sources.
